    "\n",
    "1.Mean: Mean is used to find the average of the dataset. For example, suppose we have a dataset of students' heights, and we want to set a criteria that only students above a certain height can be selected. In this case, we can use the mean.\n",

    "\n",
    "First, sort the dataset. For example, for x = {4, 5, 1, 2, 3}, we sort it to {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n",

    "\n",
    "3.Mode: Mode is used to find the value with the highest frequency in the dataset. For example, with the dataset x = {1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 6, 2, 3, 2, 2, 7, 2, 6}, the mode is indeed 2, and it appears 6 times, making it the value with the highest frequency in the dataset."

    "Ans.\n",
    "1.Variance is used to show how much the spread of data with respect to the mean by calculating the mean of the data points and subtracting from every data point, squaring the result, and then summing these squared differences. Finally, you divide the result by N (for population variance) or by n-1 (for sample variance).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's calculate the marks of 5 students: x = [60, 75, 80, 85, 90]. The mean is (60 + 75 + 80 + 85 + 90) / 5 = 78. Then, calculate the variance by subtracting each data point from the mean, squaring the result, summing these squared differences, and dividing by N (for population variance) or by n-1 (for sample variance). The population variance is 106, and the sample variance is 132.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.The standard deviation is a measure of how much individual data points typically deviate from the mean. To calculate it, we take the square root of the population variance (for population standard deviation) or the square root of the sample variance (for sample standard deviation). It helps us understand the spread of data based on the range of standard deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, using the previously calculated variances, the population standard deviation is approximately 10.29563, and the sample standard deviation is approximately 11.51086.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Range is the difference between the largest number and the smallest number in the dataset. The larger the difference, the more spread out the data is, and the smaller the difference, the less spread out the data is.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have a dataset x = [60, 75, 80, 85, 90], the range is calculated as the difference between the largest value (90) and the smallest value (60), resulting in a range of 30. This provides a simple way to describe the spread of the data"
